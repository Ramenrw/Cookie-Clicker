# My Personal Project
I would like to create a **cookie clicker game** where each click gives the player a cookie that is added to the cookie
jar. The player can then spend the accumulated cookies to buy items. More items will help players gain more cookies
passively. The player can also store the data of their current cookie jar and start on a new jar of cookies.

It will be a casual game that anyone can play. It interests me because I had spent a lot of time playing a cookie 
clicker game when I was in middle school, but lost all my progress when the computer that I played it on broke. Being
able to accumulate large quantities of cookies was very satisfying.
