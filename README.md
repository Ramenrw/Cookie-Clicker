# My Personal Project
I would like to create a **cookie clicker game** where each click gives the player a cookie. The player can then spend
the accumulated cookies to buy items. Different items will help players gain more cookies passively, based on their
cost. 
It will be a casual game that anyone can play. It interests me because I had spent a lot of time playing a cookie 
clicker game when I was in middle school, but lost all my progress when the computer that I played it on broke. Being
able to accumulate large quantities of cookies was very satisfying.
